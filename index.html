            <h4>The Core</h4>
            <p>
              Masters of Management is a Massively Multiplayer Strategy game where the players are the managers of their realms which are placed on the planets.


The planets have lifetimes of their own, from their birth to their death.


Once a planet borns, humankind starts to grow on it. Then they bring the Realms and Kingdoms.


In Masters of Management, players create their Realms on the Planets. Players manage their realms until the death of the planets. Every planet has a specific smart contract that is controlling the rules of the specific planet. Every time a planet dies, it leaves a Scoreboard behind and this scoreboard gets recorded on Harmony Blockchain. The main purpose of the game for the players, is to finalize the planets with a good score after having a unique fun with lots of strategical dynamics.


Every time a Planet dies, players earn LOP tokens depending on their scores on that planet.
